INT222 Project for 2018 Batch. 7th sem, Year: 2021/2022

### I have prepared these steps:
Step 1: Clone the project.<br />
Step 2: Run Server side.<br />
Step 3: Run Client side.<br />
Step 4: Look up for the database name in db.config.js of server side
and connect to the mongo database through mongo db console or
mongodb compass and create an entry for user.<br />
Step 5: Access the web application from http://localhost:8080/<br />
Step 6: The database is empty, so you’ll get no data in the web
application. That’s why you need to log into admin panel using the
username and password you created from mongo console before.<br />
Step 7: To Login, There is a link on footer called Admin Login and
to add entries, you can find the link to Admin panel from the same
footer after logging in.<br />
Step 8: Create entries, update entries and enjoy the full stack
application and beauty of fusion between node js and react js.<br />
Cheers!!<br />
[Note: The admin page is jwt protected, so you cannot access it or
add data unless you login using admin privilage.]
